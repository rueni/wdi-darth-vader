Write a function letterReverse that accepts a single argument, a string. The
function should maintain the order of words in the string but reverse the letters
in each word. Don't worry about punctuation. This will be very similar to round 4
except you won't need to split them with a space.

References:
MDN: String.split()
MDN: Array.reverse()
letterReverse("Now I know what a TV dinner feels like")
# => "woN I wonk tahw a VT rennid sleef ekil"
letterReverse("Put Hans back on the line")
# => "tuP snaH kcab no eht enil"
